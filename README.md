🔄 A Reset button is available to start a new game.

2️⃣ The current player's score is displayed on the screen.

3️⃣ Click "Hold" to add the current score to the player's total score. It's the next player's turn.

4️⃣ If a player rolls a one, their current score becomes zero, and it's the next player's turn.
